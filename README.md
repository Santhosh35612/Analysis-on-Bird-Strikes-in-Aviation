# ✈️ Bird-Strike Analysis in Aviation

Analyzed **68,000+** bird-strike incidents (2000–2013) from the FAA Wildlife Strike Database. Built comprehensive Tableau dashboards to identify critical risk patterns, quantify cost drivers, and deliver data-backed recommendations for improving flight safety and operational efficiency. 🐦

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* **Safety Improvements** – Identify high-risk flight phases and recurring incident patterns. 🚨
* **Regulatory Compliance** – Track improvements in reporting trends and environmental conditions. 📜
* **Cost Reduction** – Quantify financial losses across years and airlines for mitigation. 💰
* **Wildlife Conservation** – Identify species most involved in incidents and reduce ecological impact. 🌿
* **Operational Efficiency** – Analyze flight disruptions, delays, and state-wise concentration of strikes. ⚙️

## 📊 Dashboards Included

Based on the uploaded Tableau workbooks (`Project - 1.twbx`, `Project - 2.twbx`), the project includes dashboards covering:

* **Safety Improvements Dashboard** – Shows most vulnerable flight phases (Approach/Landing). ⚠️
* **Wildlife Conservation Dashboard** – Identifies frequently involved species and strike severity. 🦅
* **Operational Efficiency Dashboard** – Highlights disruptions and top affected states. 🗺️
* **Cost Reduction Dashboard** – Breaks down yearly losses and airline-wise costs. 💸
* **Regulatory Compliance Dashboard** – Tracks reporting patterns and sky conditions. 🌤️
* **KPI & Strategic Insights Dashboard** – Summarizes key metrics and actionable insights. ✨

## 📈 Key Findings

The analysis of 68,649 strikes provided the following critical insights:

| Finding Area | Key Insight | Data Point | Emote |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Safety Risk** | Approach and Landing phases show the highest strike frequency. | 24,000+ incidents during approach. | ⬇️ |
| **Financial Cost** | Total estimated industry loss. | **$140+ million** (2000–2013). | 💲 |
| **Top Wildlife** | Unknown small birds, starlings, and pigeons were most frequently involved. | 68,000+ total strikes. | 🕊️ |
| **Geographic Hotspots** | California, Texas, and Florida reported the highest number of incidents. | Highest recorded location: 2,933 (Dallas/Fort Worth). | 📍 |
| **Sky Conditions** | Nearly half of the strikes occurred under clear conditions. | 47% under clear skies. | ☀️ |
| **Airline Cost** | Business and United Airlines accounted for the highest repair and operational costs. | — | ✈️ |

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Metric |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Strikes Recorded | 68,649 |
| Unique Species Involved | 345 |
| People Injured | 21 |
| Average Annual Cost (Estimate) | $272,727 |
| Most Frequent Sky Condition | 47.4% under clear/no-cloud conditions |

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement bird-detection radar at high-risk airports. 📡
2.  **Operational Focus:** Prioritize preventive measures during **approach and landing**. 🛑
3.  **Habitat Management:** Reduce nesting and feeding grounds near airports. 🌱
4.  **Pilot Training:** Train pilots for hazard recognition and response. 👨‍✈️
5.  **Inspection Protocols:** Standardize post-strike inspections regardless of severity. 🛠️

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public** – Dashboard creation and visualization (`Project - 1.twbx`, `Project - 2.twbx`). 🎨
* **MS Excel / CSV** – Data cleaning & preprocessing (`Bird_strike_cleaned.csv`, `DS1_C7_S4_Project_BirdStrike_Data.xlsx - Bird Strikes.csv`). 🗃️
* **FAA Wildlife Strike Database** – Data source (analyzed 2000–2013 data). 📰
* **Microsoft PowerPoint** – Final report and presentation visuals (`Bird-Strikes-in-Aviation-Simple-Data-Insights-for-Safer-Flights.pptx`). 💻

## 🚀 Outcomes

* Built 6 comprehensive Tableau dashboards covering safety, wildlife, cost, and efficiency analysis. 🏆
* Provided data-backed insights and recommendations for improving aviation safety. ✅
* Demonstrated effective data visualization, storytelling, and analytical capability. 🌟
